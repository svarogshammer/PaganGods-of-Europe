Vinca culture:
Central Balkans, mainly encompassing Serbia and to a lesser extent the surrounding regions. Lots of study has been done in two main areas; Gomolava and Petnica.
The Vinca culture existed in what Lubbock (1865), referred to as the Neolithic age, meaning late stone age.
The Vinca culture was one of the first European examples of humans exerting control of their immediate environment, in terms of agriculture and animal domestication.
