Norse Mythology and paganism was largely reestricted to the area we today called Scandinavia, but in the middle-ages spanned quite a large expanse
all the way through the Celtic Isles of Great Britain, and extending as far as Russia and Ukraine, France and Italy, with Norse traders/warriors
sailing/rowing down the Dnieper river down to Constantinople in the land of the Byzantines.

Vinca culture:
Central Balkans, mainly encompassing Serbia and to a lesser extent the surrounding regions. Lots of study has been done in two main areas; Gomolava and Petnica.
The Vinca culture existed in what Lubbock (1865), referred to as the Neolithic age, meaning late stone age.
The Vinca culture was one of the first European examples of humans exerting control of their immediate environment, in terms of agriculture and animal domestication.
